# School District Analysis

## Project Overview:
During this project, I had to analyze the data of a School District. I utlized the following tools in my process: anaconda, python, pandas library, numpy library, and jupyter notebook. The data was provided by the Maria, the CDS (Chief Data Scientist) of the City School District. The analysis created insights on each school's performance mertrics. After creating the initial analysis, the school board identified academic dishonsty among students. During the second analysis, we pinpointed a subset of the data and created a new set of findings. This allowed the analysis to be more thorough.
